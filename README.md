Tom Tang and Ethan Van Bruchem's semester 2 digital technology project.

Pixel Dungeon 64
This is an RPG game using pixel art. You will fight monsters, explore dungeon floors, find treasure, and win the game!
A fun game for all the family.

Current progress:
HTML is (mostly) complete!
The map editor is at version 2: I can currently add new maps, but I can only use the mossy wall and the blank space
