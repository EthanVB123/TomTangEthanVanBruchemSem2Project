# CONTROLS
Move the player with the WASD keys.
Use the 1-4 keys to attack with your weapons. (You only have a weapon equipped in 1-2.)
z ends your turn, refilling your MP and letting the enemies move and attack.
m heals you and gives you XP, at the cost of MP.
There is a cheat button, but we're not telling you what it is!
* Disclaimer: The buttons don't do anything. We're aware of this, and it is intentional, so please no complains that the buttons don't work.
