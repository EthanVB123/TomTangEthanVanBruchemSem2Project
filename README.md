Pixel Dungeon 64
This is an RPG game using pixel art. You will fight monsters, explore dungeon floors, find treasure, and win the game!
A fun game for all the family.

Current progress:
VERSION 1.2
HTML is (mostly) complete!
The map editor is at version 2: I can currently add new maps, but I can only use the mossy wall and the blank space

Changelog:

VERSION 1.2
- I can now change the map from the code.

VERSION 1.1
- Added a map of 100 <div>s, with placeholder images of Blue Slime
  
VERSION 1.0
- HTML at a basic standard, map not done.
